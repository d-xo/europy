# Model Based Testing

- Model system as a graph (finite state machine)
- Generate testcases by walking over graph 
<br>
- Tests are more *flexible*
- Tests find *new bugs*
- Tests may not always be the same

---

## Building the Model

- Nodes are states to be verified
- Edges are actions to be taken
<br>
- Graphwalker takes a graphml file and generates an interface
