# Model Based Testing

- Model system as a graph (finite state machine)
- Generate testcases by walking over graph 
<br>
- *More declarative*
- *Reduced coupling*
- *Tests find new bugs*
- **Tests may not always be the same**

---

## Building the Model

- Nodes are states to be verified
- Edges are actions to be taken
<br><br>---------------------------<br><br>
- :disappointed: Java library
- graphml -> interface file
